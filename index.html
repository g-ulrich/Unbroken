			<center><font size="6">What does it mean to be unbroken?</font></center></b></p></br>
				<p><font size="4">The word unbroken is the effect and cure of the brokenness the world is in bondage to. A Christian is unbroken because of the gospel.
				The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 
				died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over the world's lawlessness, 
				so that there is now no eternal brokenness for those who believe in Him. </p></br>
				
				<p><font size="4"><b>Hold on, are'nt I a good person? I'm not lawless.</font></b></p>
				
				Your right! However, the mistake all of us do is appeal to our own standard of goodness. 
				You see, our standard will always be higher than our friend's standards and vice versa. 
				This means that our moral standards are shaky if they are not based off of a higher standard than our own. 
				</br>
				</br>
				I need you to imagine something. While reading this, picture a man in court pleading not guilty for rape and pedophilia. 
				The judge is given clear evidence and sentences the man to prison. 
				</br>
				</br>
				Even though the man pleaded not guilty the man is considered lawless and is convicted rightly for his crime. 
				As you can see the judge appealed to the standard of the law, 
				designed and constructed by a higher authority.

				<b>Suprise!</b> No body is perfect. 
				</br>
				</br>
				</br>
				
				Just like the man that was sent to jail for breaking the law. 
				We have broken God's laws and must pay the penalty. 
				</br>
				</br>
				I am not judging you, but according to God's laws you are guilty. 
				</br>
				</br>
				Hebrews 9 says that everyone is appointed to die once and face judgement. 
				On judgement day when God judges you by His eternal and holy law will you be <b>innocent</b> or <b>guilty</b>. Will you go to 
				<b>heaven</b> or <b>hell</b>?
