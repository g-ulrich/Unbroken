						What does it mean to be unbroken?

				</center>
			</b></p>
		</br>
			<p>
				<font size="4">
					The word unbroken is the effect and cure of the brokenness the world is in bondage to. 
					A Christian is unbroken because of the gospel.
					The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 
					died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over the world's lawlessness, 
					so that there is now no eternal brokenness for those who believe in Him.

				Your right! However, the mistake all of us do is appeal to our own standard of goodness. 
				You see, our standard will always be higher than our friend's standards and vice versa. 
				This means that our moral standards are shaky if they are not based off of a higher standard than our own. 
		</br>
		</br>
				I need you to imagine something. While reading this, picture a man in court pleading not guilty for rape and pedophilia. 
				The judge is given clear evidence and sentences the man to prison. 
		</br>
		</br>
				Even though the man pleaded not guilty the man is considered lawless and is convicted rightly for his crime. 
				As you can see the judge appealed to the standard of the law, 
				designed and constructed by a higher authority.

<!---------------------------------------------------- FURTHER EXPLAINATION ----------------------------------------------------------->
			</br>	
				<b>Surprise!</b> Nobody is perfect. 
			</br>
			</br>
			</br>
				Just like the man that was sent to jail for breaking the law. 
				We have broken God's laws and must pay the penalty. 
			</br>
			</br>
				I am not judging you, but according to God's laws you are guilty. 
			</br>
			</br>
				Hebrews 9 says that everyone is appointed to die once and face judgement. 
				On judgement day when God judges you by His ten commandments will you be 
				<b>innocent</b> or 
				<b>guilty</b>? Will you go to 
				<b>heaven</b> or 
				<b>hell</b>?
			</br>
			</br>
				Does this concern you? You are going to be sentenced to an eternity in Hell. 
				God is an eternal perfectly 
				<a title="Click for definition :)" target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/just"> 
				just</a> 
				judge and His authority far outweighs any government, authority, principality or dominion.
			<br/>
			<br/>
				<b>Why does breaking one of God's laws merit an eternity in hell?</b> 
			<br/>
				The simple answer is because God is eternal. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
				To make things clearer let's create a scenerio,

				Imagine you get to slap three people in the face:
				
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Your family member,</li>
					<br/>
					<li>a police officer and</li>
					<br/>
					<li>the President of the United States 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Donald_Trump_official_portrait.jpg/220px-Donald_Trump_official_portrait.jpg">
						<img title="Click for the president" src="flag.gif"></li>
					</a>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<b>What happens next?</b>
				<ul>
				<br/>
				<li>You slap your family member in their face and they hit you back. </li>
				<br/> 
				
				<li>You slap a police officer in their face and they throw you in jail. </li>
				<br/>
				
				<li>However, the punishment for slapping the president of the United States in the face would 
				get you shot by the secret service.</li>
				</ul>
			
			<br/>
				This is an example of the same action, but with different punishments. 
				The reason the punishment is much higher when slapping the president is because the president has much more authority than anyone else. 
				In comparison to an eternal God who created the universe I'm sure you can see why the punishment is so severe. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
				
				<b>The summation:</b><br/>
				You have broken God's laws and you are guilty before and eternal God. No matter how you plead you must pay the fine.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				No matter how many <a title="Click for definition :)" target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/finite">finite</a> 
				good things you do in your life you will never be good enough. This is because God's standards are
				<a title="Click for definition :)" target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infinite">infinitely</a> 
				good. In other words you can never pay the fine. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
				2018 years ago, Jesus Christ (God 
				<a title="Click for definition :)" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&client=firefox-b-1-ab&ei=ogFdW5auN4ie_Qbj_7-gDw&q=incarnate+definition&oq=incarnate+definition&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l4j0i22i30k1l6.6538.7856.0.8103.11.5.0.5.5.0.279.514.2-2.2.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..5.6.337....0.DyNRQc3CA7w">incarnate</a>) 
				stepped in and paid the fine for you. Spiritually we are all dead in our sin and spiritually we must be brought back to life. 
				In other words, we are broken and to be unbroken we need Jesus Christ.
